          Our focus is on the long-term preservation of affordable multifamily rental housing.
          We purchase tax-exempt housing bonds that are used as &ldquo;bridge financing&rdquo;
          where fast closings and good terms are a critical part of the transaction â€“ and a
          new permanent loan will be obtained in tdhe near-term following closing.

        <p class="lede">AFM&rsquo;s Impact Bond Program &ldquo;IBP&rdquo; is a funding platform designed to
          help assure that the nation&rsquo;s existing affordable multifamily rental housing
          stock is maintained.</p>

        <p class="question">What kind of impact does AFM&rsquo;s IBP create?</p>

        <p>We provide qualified non-profit or government related borrowers the opportunity to competitively acquire
          apartment properties.</p>

        <p>Preservation of existing housing provides communities with continuity of affordable rental housing and
          in-place residents with the assurance that their home will not be converted to a condo or market rent
          unit.</p>

        <p>It is estimated that between 2014 and 2020 close to one-half of all of the existing low income housing tax
          credit properties will exit from their initial 15 year LIHTC restriction period (approximately two million
          units). Many of those properties could be converted to market rate apartments or even condos. We provide
          institutional capital to qualified borrowers who will have the mission and purpose of assuring that these
          expiring properties (and others) are recommitted to the affordable housing stock.</p>

        <h3><span class="highlight">CRA</span> Investing</h3>

        <p class="lede">As a national CRA investment platform AFM provides investment and CRA-qualified opportunities,
          thus spreading
          and mitigating risk while reducing institutional CRA costs.</p>

        <p>Because 100% of the assets collateralizing our bonds are for the preservation of &ldquo;at-risk&rdquo;
          affordable housing,
          AFM believes it&rsquo;s platform is a CRA qualified investment and will meet &ldquo;Investment Test&rdquo;
          and &ldquo;Creativity Test&rdquo;
          criteria. <i class="fa fa-asterisk"></i></p>

        <p>Assets may be targeted to an institution&rsquo;s assessment area.<br>
          Unlike direct LIHTC investments, AFM does not have long-term holding periods.<br>
          CRA regulations do not differentiate between "direct" and "indirect" investments. Thus an institution's
          investment in a fund whose primary purpose is supporting community development and/or affordable housing
          should
          receive positive consideration as a qualified investment under the CRA regulations, subject in some cases to
          assessment area considerations.*
        </p>
        <aside>
          * While AFM has met with the FRB, OCC and the FDIC it is important for all regulated entities to
          independently verify CRA lending and investment test qualification.
